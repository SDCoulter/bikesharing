## Challenge - Overview

For this module we were introduces to Tableau, an industry-leading data visualization application. We were supplied with a dataset of bicycle trips from the NYC service CitiBike - a bicycle sharing program based in New York. This dataset contained all the trips taken place in August 2019 and included a breakdown of the users and the trip lengths. We were tasked with analysing the data and presenting our findings using data visualizations built in Tableau.

The background behind the challenge is to determine whether this similar service could be deployed in Des Moines, Iowa. We would use our visualizations as well as some higher-level analysis to produce a Tableau story from the data and report our findings. We would also be required to suggest further analysis that should be undertaken should a company wish to supply this service.

We use a variety of visualizations in this module, including bar charts, pie charts and heatmaps. We also saved the story compiled from our worksheets to Tableau public, the link of which can be found above. A detailed discussion of our story follows in the results section.

## Challenge - Results

Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis.
There is a description of the results for each visualization.

Using the 5 created in Deliverable 2 and 2 from the module create the Story and then use each point here.

## Challenge - Summary

Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis.

## Context

This is the result of Module 14 of the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies Data Analysis Bootcamp Course - **Ny CitiBike with Tableau** - Analysing a NY CitiBike dataset with Tableau. Following the guidance of the module we end up pushing this selection of files to GitHub.
