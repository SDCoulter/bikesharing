## Challenge - Overview

For this module we were introduces to Tableau, an industry-leading data visualization application. We were supplied with a dataset of bicycle trips from the NYC service CitiBike - a bicycle sharing program based in New York. This dataset contained all the trips taken place in August 2019 and included a breakdown of the users and the trip lengths. We were tasked with analysing the data and presenting our findings using data visualizations built in Tableau.

The background behind the challenge is to determine whether this similar service could be deployed in Des Moines, Iowa. We would use our visualizations as well as some higher-level analysis to produce a Tableau story from the data and report our findings. We would also be required to suggest further analysis that should be undertaken should a company wish to supply this service.

We use a variety of visualizations in this module, including bar charts, pie charts and heatmaps. We also saved the story compiled from our worksheets to Tableau public, the link of which can be found above. A detailed discussion of our story follows in the results section.

## Challenge - Results

Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath the image.

There are at least seven visualizations for the NYC Citibike analysis.
There is a description of the results for each visualization.

Using the 5 created in Deliverable 2 and 2 from the module create the Story and then use each point here.

***Challenge Graph*** - **Average Checkout Times for Users**: The average (in this case, mode) length of a bike rental/trip duration is for a 4-6-minute journey. This would imply that in NYC there were an abundance of places to travel to that are nearby to each other - this includes workplaces and housing/apartments. In more spaced-out metropolitan areas, you could expect to see the trip duration increase until it became infeasible to use a bike rather than a car, i.e., more suburban areas. New York City is well known for its dense population and high traffic so short trips on a bike are plentiful.

![Gender Breakdown](images/2_gender_breakdown.png)

***Module Graph*** - **Gender Breakdown Pie Chart**: Here we see a pie chart representing the gender breakdown of bike users. Around two thirds of the users are male, a quarter are female, and roughly nine percent are unknown. This shows the CitiBike service is mainly dominated by male users.

![Checkout Times by Gender](images/3_gender_checkout.png)

***Challenge Graph*** - **Checkout Times by Gender**: Here we see essentially the first two graphs combined. We see the same male dominance in bicycle usage, but also the same peak trip durations for both genders of 4-6-minutes - so, the length of the journeys is not gender dependent. The unknown gender category does not have such a defined peak, with the more popular trip durations anywhere between 8-30 minutes.

![Customer Subscriber Breakdown](images/4_customer_breakdown.png)

***Module Graph*** - **Customer/Subscriber Breakdown**: This graph shows the breakdown of user type, where subscriber refers to a user with an annual subscription to the service, and customers are those with 1-3-day passes to the service. Subscribers make up 80+% of CitiBike users, this would imply that most of the users are residents of NYC rather than tourists, as tourists have little need to purchase a year-long membership. Given this knowledge and the fact that most journeys are 4-6-minutes we can begin to see CitiBike is mostly being used for work commutes.

## Challenge - Summary

Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the given dataset.
There is a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis.

## Context

This is the result of Module 14 of the University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies Data Analysis Bootcamp Course - **Ny CitiBike with Tableau** - Analysing a NY CitiBike dataset with Tableau. Following the guidance of the module we end up pushing this selection of files to GitHub.
